# Contributing

All active development is done on a
[self-hosted Gitlab server](https://gitlab.namibsun.net).
To contribute, send an email to hermann@krumreyh.com to create an account.
Once you have an account, you may issue a merge/pull request.

Using the Gitlab issue tracker is preferred, but the issues on Github are also
taken into consideration.
